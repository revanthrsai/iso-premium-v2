// ===========================================================================
//
// WHAT THIS IS
//   The index of every long-form article in /content. This is the Markdown
//   architecture's answer to the old hardcoded lists: articles live as .md
//   files; this file just orders and describes them so the Learn index can be
//   built WITHOUT fetching every article up front.
//
// HOW IT RELATES TO data.js (Hybrid model — see ACADEMY_BLUEPRINT_PLAN.md)
//   data.js still powers the *interactive* surfaces (Playground, Message
//   Explorer, Glossary, Journey). toc.js + /content power *reading* — the
//   long-form articles. An article can hand off to an interactive surface via
//   an {{embed:...}} token (handled in markdown.js).
//
// THE NUMBERING (university-style difficulty × domain)
//   100  Fundamentals  — banking concepts, money movement, clearing,
//                         correspondent banking. No XML yet.
//   200  Architecture  — the ISO 20022 standard itself: the Business
//                         Application Header, namespaces, structure.
//   300  Message Deep Dives — the happy-path messages, field by field
//                         (pain.001, pacs.008, camt.054, …).
//   400  Exceptions    — R-transactions: cancellations (camt.056),
//                         returns (pacs.004), routing failures.
//
// ADDING AN ARTICLE
//   1. Drop  content/<num>-<slug>.md  with a YAML frontmatter block.
//   2. Add one entry below. `id` MUST equal the filename without .md.
//   The listing metadata here should mirror the file's frontmatter; the file
//   is the source of truth once an article is opened.
