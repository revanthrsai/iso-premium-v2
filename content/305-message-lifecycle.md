> **The problem first.** You now know four families on their own — pain instructs, pacs settles, camt reports, head wraps. But a real payment doesn't use them one at a time, in isolation. Bob taps "send" once, and a relay race begins: each family takes the baton, runs its leg, and hands off to the next, until ₹33,000 reaches Sweety and everyone has been told it arrived. So what does the *whole* chain look like, in order — and what makes a payment that a dozen banks touched still readable as one journey?

This page is the map. Every message family in Level 300 exists to own one stretch of a payment's life. Put them in order and the standard stops being a pile of acronyms and becomes a single, legible story.

The shape to hold in your head: **a customer instructs (pain), banks settle (pacs), everyone is told (camt) — and every message travels inside an envelope (head).**

## One payment, family by family

Follow Bob's ₹33,000 from his kitchen in Dubai to Sweety's account in Bangalore. Each numbered step belongs to exactly one family.

1. **pain.001 — the instruction.** Bob's app builds a Customer Credit Transfer Initiation and sends it to *his own bank*. This is the only step a customer touches directly. *(Family: pain.)*
2. **pain.002 — the receipt.** Bob's bank validates it and replies: accepted. Bob sees a tick. Still, no money has moved. *(Family: pain.)*
3. **pacs.008 — the execution.** Bob's bank becomes the debtor agent, turns the accepted instruction into an interbank credit transfer, and sends it toward Sweety's bank — through intermediaries if the two banks have never met. *This is the handoff: pain ends, pacs begins.* *(Family: pacs.)*
4. **pacs.002 — the confirmation.** Sweety's bank applies the funds and sends a status report back up the chain: settled. *(Family: pacs.)* *(Had her account been closed, a **pacs.004** return would send the money home instead.)*
5. **camt.054 — the notification.** Sweety's bank fires a single-event credit notification: "₹33,000 just arrived." Her accounting system matches it to Invoice 0042 on the spot. *(Family: camt.)*
6. **camt.053 — the statement.** At day's end, the authoritative statement closes the books, and reconciliation — the last stage of the lifecycle — is complete. *(Family: camt.)*

And wrapping **every single one** of those messages on the wire: a **head.001 Business Application Header**, the envelope telling the network who sent each message, to whom, and what's inside — while **admi** messages quietly keep the rails open underneath.

## The thread that ties it together

Six messages, several banks, two countries — and yet it's *one* payment. What makes that true is a small set of references that survive every hop:

- **`EndToEndId` — Bob's own reference** (`BOB-INV0042`). Bob's app set it in the pain.001; the pacs.008 carried it untouched; it surfaced again inside the camt.054 entry. It's why Sweety's "Invoice 0042" is recognisable from the first tap to the final statement.
- **`UETR` — the unique end-to-end transaction reference.** A globally unique id stamped on the interbank leg, the engine behind "where is my payment right now?" tracking across every bank in the chain.

A reference set at the start and preserved to the end is what lets a payment touched by a dozen institutions still be tracked, matched, and reconciled as a single journey. Lose the thread and you have six unrelated messages; keep it and you have one payment.

## The map, in one line per family

- **pain** — the customer's side of the glass: instruct (pain.001), get a receipt (pain.002).
- **pacs** — the interbank engine room: move the money (pacs.008), confirm or return it (pacs.002 / pacs.004).
- **camt** — closing the loop: notify (camt.054), then state and reconcile (camt.053).
- **head & admi** — the envelope around every message, and the housekeeping that keeps the network alive.

Read those four lines top to bottom and you've read the life of a payment. Want to go deeper on any leg? Each family's own page is one tap away below — and when you're ready to stop reading and start *handling* messages, the Playground has a live one waiting.

## So, what can you now do?

You can trace one payment end-to-end through pain, pacs, and camt — naming which family owns each step and where one hands off to the next — explain that every message rides inside a head.001 envelope over admi-maintained rails, and point to the `EndToEndId` and `UETR` as the threads that let a payment crossing many banks still be read, tracked, and reconciled as a single journey. That completes Level 300.
