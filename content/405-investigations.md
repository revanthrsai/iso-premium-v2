summary: "Sometimes nothing is rejected, returned, or reversed — the payment simply vanishes or arrives wrong, and someone has to open a case. Investigations are the structured conversation that finds the money."

> **The problem first.** Bob's payment to Sweety left his account three days ago. It wasn't rejected — no red cross. It wasn't returned — no money came back. It just... never arrived. Somewhere among the intermediary banks the payment is sitting, mislabelled or stuck, and the `UETR` tracking shows it reached a correspondent and then went silent. Nobody did anything obviously wrong, so none of the clean exceptions fired. How do banks *hunt down* a payment that simply disappeared — without phoning each other up?

The last three chapters were tidy. A reject, a return, a reversal each has a clear cause and a single message that puts it right. **Investigations** are the messy reality: a payment that didn't fail cleanly. It's late, lost, applied to the wrong account, missing its remittance information, or stuck at a correspondent — and finding out *why* takes a back-and-forth conversation between banks.

An investigation is **case management for payments**: open a case, ask a question, get an answer, close the case. ISO 20022 gives that conversation its own family of messages so it can happen machine-to-machine instead of over email.

## When you need an investigation

You open an investigation when a payment is wrong or missing but **none of the clean exceptions apply** — there's nothing to simply reject, return, or reverse, because first you have to find out what happened:

- **The money never arrived** (the beneficiary claims non-receipt).
- **It arrived but can't be applied** — the account reference is wrong or ambiguous, so the receiving bank is holding funds it can't post.
- **It arrived short, or without the information** needed to reconcile it (missing invoice reference).
- **A previous request needs more detail** before anyone can act.

## Which messages carry an investigation

These are the **camt** case-management messages — the exceptions-and-investigations corner of the camt family:

- **camt.027 — Claim Non Receipt.** The beneficiary's bank: *"Our customer says the money never arrived — where is it?"*
- **camt.026 — Unable To Apply.** The receiving bank: *"We got the money but can't post it — the account reference doesn't match anyone. Help us apply it."*
- **camt.028 — Additional Payment Information.** Either side supplying the missing detail the other asked for.
- **camt.029 — Resolution of Investigation.** The message that **closes the case** — *resolved this way, here's the outcome.* (The same camt.029 you met answering a recall: it's the universal "here's how it ended" message.)

A case opens with a question (camt.026 or camt.027), exchanges detail (camt.028), and closes with a resolution (camt.029).

## The resolution flow

1. **Bob's bank opens a case.** Three days on with no credit, it sends a **camt.027 Claim Non Receipt** referencing `BOB-INV0042` and the `UETR`, addressed down the chain.
2. **The correspondent investigates.** It finds the pacs.008 sitting unposted — the creditor account reference was ambiguous — so it raises a **camt.026 Unable To Apply** asking for clarification.
3. **Bob's bank answers with a camt.028 Additional Payment Information** — confirming Sweety's correct account.
4. **The correspondent applies the funds** and sends a **camt.029 Resolution of Investigation**: resolved, credited, case closed.
5. **If the money genuinely can't be delivered**, the camt.029 might instead resolve the case by triggering a **pacs.004 return** — the investigation hands off to the clean exception that fits.

The thread through all of it is the same `UETR` (`eb6305c9-…`) from the original pacs.008. That single globally-unique id is what makes "where is my payment?" answerable across a dozen banks — every investigation message quotes it, so the whole case stays pinned to one payment.

## How investigations differ from the clean exceptions

The other four exceptions answer *"what's the right action?"* An investigation answers the prior question: *"what actually happened?"* It's a **conversation**, not a single message — and it often **ends** by triggering one of the clean exceptions (a camt.029 that authorises a pacs.004 return, say). Think of investigations as the layer that sits above reject/return/recall/reversal, used whenever the situation is too unclear to act on directly.

## Where Level 400 leaves you

You now have the full exceptions map. Every payment that doesn't sail through cleanly ends up as one of these:

- **Reject** — refused before settlement (`pacs.002` / `pain.002`, status `RJCT`).
- **Return** — settled but undeliverable, sent back by the receiver (`pacs.004`).
- **Recall** — settled, the sender asks for it back (`camt.056` → `camt.029`).
- **Reversal** — settled, the originator undoes its own collection by right (`pacs.007`).
- **Investigation** — unclear or missing; open a case, find out, then act (`camt.026/027/028` → `camt.029`).

## So, what can you now do?

You can explain what an investigation is and when it's the right tool (a payment that's wrong or missing but doesn't fit a clean exception), name the case-management messages (`camt.027` claim non-receipt, `camt.026` unable to apply, `camt.028` additional info, `camt.029` resolution), describe how a case opens with a question and closes with a resolution, follow the `UETR` that keeps the whole case pinned to one payment, and explain how an investigation can hand off to a return or recall once the facts are known.
