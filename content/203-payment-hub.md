> **The problem first.** A clean payment has just come through the bank's front door. Now a decision has to be made: should it go out on the fast, expensive road, or the cheap overnight one? Does it need a fraud check, a currency conversion, a compliance hold? And which of the bank's many systems should actually handle it? If every channel answered those questions its own way, the bank would behave differently depending on where a payment came in. Something central has to make those calls consistently for every payment. That something is the hub.

In [The Payment Gateway](#) a payment was authenticated, validated, translated, and handed inside the bank in one clean format. This article is about what receives it. The **payment hub** is the central engine — the brain — that takes each payment and **orchestrates** its journey through the bank: deciding its route, running it through the necessary steps, and sending it on its way. If the gateway is the front door, the hub is everything the building does once you're inside.

## The mess the hub was invented to fix

Banks didn't always have a hub. For years, each kind of payment had its **own** processing system: one for domestic transfers, one for cross-border, one for salaries, one for cards. Each was a separate silo with its own rules, its own format, its own team. The same customer payment might be handled completely differently depending on which silo it fell into, and adding a new payment type meant building a whole new silo.

The payment hub replaces those silos with **one central engine** that all channels feed into and all the bank's roads lead out of. Every payment, whatever its origin, flows through the same brain — so the bank behaves consistently, and a new payment type or a new system can be plugged into one place instead of rebuilt everywhere.

## What "orchestration" actually means

Orchestration is the hub's core word, and it's a good one: the hub is the conductor, and a payment's journey is a short piece of music with movements that must happen in the right order. For each payment, the hub works through questions like:

- **Which road does this belong on?** Large and urgent, or routine and batched? Domestic or cross-border? The hub picks the right system from [Payment Systems](#) for this specific payment.
- **What checks does it still need?** Sanctions screening, fraud scoring, a compliance hold, a limit check — the hub runs the payment through whichever apply.
- **Does anything need converting or adding?** A currency conversion, a fee, an enrichment from the bank's own records.
- **In what order?** Many of these steps depend on each other; the hub sequences them so nothing happens out of turn.

The hub doesn't necessarily *perform* every one of these itself — it often calls out to specialist systems (a fraud engine, a screening service) and waits for their answers. Its job is to **coordinate**: to make sure each step happens, in the right order, for every payment, and to carry the payment from one step to the next.

## Where the hub sits in the lifecycle

Map the hub onto the five stages from [The Payment Lifecycle](#) and it snaps into place. The gateway handled the front-door part of **initiation and validation**. The hub then drives the payment through the rest of **validation** (the deeper checks), prepares it for **clearing**, and dispatches it toward **settlement** on the system it chose. It is the engine that moves a payment across the middle of its own lifecycle inside the walls of one bank.

It also keeps the bank's promise to itself: a single, trustworthy record of every payment in flight, so the bank always knows what it has accepted, where each payment is, and what it owes — the raw material for the **reconciliation** stage later.

## Hub versus gateway versus system

Three words from this level are easy to blur, so hold them apart with one sentence:

> The **gateway** is the door a payment comes *in* through; the **hub** is the brain that decides what to *do* with it and where to send it; the **payment system** is the road it travels *out* on to reach another bank.

Door, brain, road. A payment enters through the gateway, is orchestrated by the hub, and leaves on a system. The one piece still missing is the very fast, very specialised router that handles split-second decisions for instant and card payments — and that's the [Payment Switch](#), the next article.

## So, what can you now do?

You can explain why a modern bank funnels all its payments through one central engine instead of a pile of separate silos, and what that engine actually does: route each payment to the right system, run it through the checks and conversions it needs, in the right order, and dispatch it onward — all while holding a single trusted record of everything in flight. And you can keep the gateway, the hub, and the payment system cleanly apart as door, brain, and road. That three-part picture is the skeleton of how a payment moves through a bank.
