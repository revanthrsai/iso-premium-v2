> **The problem first.** Sweety's ₹33,000 has landed. Her bank applied the funds, the pacs.008 settled, everyone's happy. But Sweety doesn't work at the bank — she's at her desk in Bangalore, and as far as she can tell, *nothing has happened* until her bank tells her something did. And her accountant needs more: not just "money arrived," but *which* invoice it paid, on *what* date, leaving *what* balance. Who sends that, and what does it look like?

That's the **camt family** — short for **Cash Management**. If pain is you instructing your bank and pacs is banks moving the money, camt is everyone being *told what happened* afterwards. It is the reporting layer of the payment world: statements, notifications, and balances.

One line to keep: **pain and pacs make money move; camt tells you that it did.** No money settles inside a camt message — it is information about money that already moved.

## The purpose: closing the loop

A payment isn't finished when the funds settle. It's finished when both sides can *see* it settled and tie it back to what they were owed — the step Level 100 called **reconciliation**. The camt family is what makes reconciliation possible at scale: instead of a human logging into a portal, a bank sends a structured report that a company's accounting system can read and match automatically.

It replaces a tangle of older formats — the legacy SWIFT **MT940** statement, **MT942** interim report, **MT900/910** debit and credit advices, plus a hundred proprietary bank file formats. The camt family gives every bank one shared shape for "here is what happened on your account."

## Who's in the family

Three messages do almost all the everyday work, and they differ mainly in *scope* and *timing*:

- **camt.053 — Bank-to-Customer Statement.** The end-of-day statement. Every booked entry on the account for the period, plus opening and closing balances. The workhorse of reconciliation, and the replacement for MT940.
- **camt.052 — Bank-to-Customer Account Report.** The *intraday* report — the same idea, but provisional and mid-day: "here's where you stand right now," before the day is closed. Replaces MT942.
- **camt.054 — Bank-to-Customer Debit/Credit Notification.** A single-event nudge: "one specific entry just hit your account." This is the message that tells Sweety's accounting system *the moment* her ₹33,000 arrived, rather than waiting for the nightly statement. Replaces MT900/910.

Two more you'll meet later: **camt.060** asks the bank to *send* a report (a request, not a report itself), and **camt.056** — the payment cancellation request — belongs to the exceptions world you'll study in Level 400.

Tell the first three apart by scope: **camt.054 is one entry now, camt.052 is the whole account so far today, camt.053 is the whole account at day's close.**

## The lifecycle: where reporting sits

camt messages don't start a payment — they trail it. Following Sweety's ₹33,000:

1. **The pacs.008 settles** at Sweety's bank and the funds are applied to her account.
2. **Her bank fires a camt.054** credit notification almost immediately — a single-event "this just arrived" that her accounting system can match to Invoice 0042 without waiting.
3. **Through the day, a camt.052** intraday report shows the provisional running position if her treasury team asks for it.
4. **At end of day, a camt.053** statement closes the books — every entry, opening and closing balance — the authoritative record her accountant reconciles against.

The same references thread through all of it. The `EndToEndId` Bob set back in the pain.001 — `BOB-INV0042` — rides the pacs.008 into Sweety's bank and surfaces again here, inside the camt entry, which is exactly how her system knows this credit pays *that* invoice.

## A sample camt.054

A credit notification, trimmed to the essentials — notice it reports an entry, it doesn't move one:

```xml
<BkToCstmrDbtCdtNtfctn>
  <GrpHdr>
    <MsgId>HDFCINBB-NTFCN-20260629-0007</MsgId>
    <CreDtTm>2026-06-29T14:02:11+05:30</CreDtTm>
  </GrpHdr>
  <Ntfctn>
    <Id>NTFCN-0007</Id>
    <Acct><Id><IBAN>INHDFC0SWEETY00033445</IBAN></Id></Acct>
    <Ntry>
      <Amt Ccy="INR">33000.00</Amt>
      <CdtDbtInd>CRDT</CdtDbtInd>
      <Sts><Cd>BOOK</Cd></Sts>
      <BookgDt><Dt>2026-06-29</Dt></BookgDt>
      <NtryDtls><TxDtls>
        <Refs><EndToEndId>BOB-INV0042</EndToEndId></Refs>
        <RltdPties><Dbtr><Nm>Bob Marsh</Nm></Dbtr></RltdPties>
        <RmtInf><Ustrd>Invoice 0042 — June freelance</Ustrd></RmtInf>
      </TxDtls></NtryDtls>
    </Ntry>
  </Ntfctn>
</BkToCstmrDbtCdtNtfctn>
```

Read it as a sentence: a **credit** (`CdtDbtInd = CRDT`) of **33,000 INR** was **booked** (`Sts = BOOK`) on Sweety's account on 29 June, sent by **Bob**, for **Invoice 0042**. That single `EndToEndId` is the thread back to the instruction Bob typed in his kitchen — the reason reconciliation works at all.

## So, what can you now do?

You can explain what the camt family is for — reporting, not moving — tell camt.053 (end-of-day statement) from camt.052 (intraday report) from camt.054 (single-entry notification), say which legacy MT messages each one replaced, and place reporting at its proper spot in the life of a payment: the step that finally closes the loop.
