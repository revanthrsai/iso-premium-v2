> **The problem first.** Sweety runs a gym and collects ₹2,000 a month from members by direct debit — she *pulls* the money rather than waiting for them to push it. This month a glitch charged Bob ₹20,000 instead of ₹2,000. The money already left Bob's account and settled in Sweety's. Bob didn't make a mistake; Sweety did, and she pulled funds she had every right to pull — just the wrong amount. She doesn't need to *ask* anyone to fix it. How does the party who *collected* a payment cleanly undo its own settled collection?

You've now seen three exceptions. A **reject** stops a payment before settlement. A **return** is the receiver sending settled money back because it can't apply it. A **recall** is the sender *asking* for settled money back after its own mistake. A **reversal** is the fourth and most often misunderstood: the **originator undoing its own settled payment — by right, not by request.**

The key difference from a recall: a recall is a **question** the receiver can refuse. A reversal is a **statement** — the party that initiated the payment is entitled to reverse it, and does.

## Where reversals live: the pull world

Reversals almost always belong to **direct debits** — payments where the *creditor pulls* money rather than the debtor pushing it. (You met the puller, pacs.003, in the pacs family.) Pull payments carry a built-in risk the push world doesn't: the person taking the money decides the amount, so they're the one who can get it wrong — a duplicate collection, the wrong figure, a debit run that fired twice.

When that happens, the collector — who initiated the whole thing — is the natural party to put it right. They don't need the debtor's bank to volunteer a return, and they don't need to beg for a recall. They simply **reverse** their own collection.

## What triggers a reversal

- A **direct debit collected in error** — wrong amount, wrong day, duplicate run.
- A **mandate problem** discovered after collection (the authorisation was invalid).
- A **technical double-collection** the originator must unwind.

In each case the *originator of the original payment* is the one acting, and the original payment was theirs to make.

## Which messages perform a reversal

- **pacs.007 — FI to FI Payment Reversal.** The interbank message that reverses a previously-settled payment between banks, carrying a reversal reason and references to the original. It sends the money back the way it came — but on the originator's own authority.
- **pain.007 — Customer Payment Reversal.** The customer-side equivalent: the creditor's system telling its bank to reverse a collection it initiated.

A pacs.007 *moves money* (like a pacs.004 return), but the trigger is different: a return answers a delivery failure on the receiving side, while a reversal answers a mistake on the **originating** side — with no permission needed.

## The resolution flow

1. **Sweety's system collected** ₹20,000 from Bob by direct debit; it settled.
2. **Sweety's bank spots the error** (or Bob complains and the scheme rules kick in).
3. **Sweety's bank originates a pacs.007** reversing the original collection, with a reversal reason (e.g. wrong amount, duplicate).
4. **The reversal settles back** to Bob's bank, which **re-credits Bob**. The original collection and its reversal both reference the same payment, so the two cancel out cleanly on everyone's books.

Note the `RvsdIntrBkSttlmAmt` — like a return, a reversal carries a real amount, because money genuinely moves back. What it does *not* carry is any sense of asking permission: there is no resolution message to wait for, the way a recall waits on a camt.029.

## Reversal vs. recall — the one that trips everyone

Both happen after settlement; both are initiated by the *originating* side; both can put money back. The difference is **authority**:

- **Recall (camt.056 → camt.029)** — the sender *asks*. The receiver can say no. Money moves only if granted.
- **Reversal (pacs.007)** — the originator *acts*. No one is asked. The reversal stands on the originator's own right to undo what it initiated — which is why it lives in the direct-debit (pull) world, where the originator pulled the money in the first place.

Rule of thumb: if you **pushed** money to someone and want it back, you **recall** (and hope). If you **pulled** money and got it wrong, you **reverse** (because it was yours to pull).

## So, what can you now do?

You can explain what a reversal is, name the message that performs it (`pacs.007`, with `pain.007` on the customer side), describe why a reversal needs no permission while a recall does, connect reversals to the direct-debit world where the originator pulled the funds, and place all four Level 400 exceptions on one timeline: reject (before settlement), then return, recall, and reversal (all after).
